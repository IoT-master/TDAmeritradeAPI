# TDAmeritradeAPI

I'm building this to modernize the APIs in Python3. Some APIs requires obtaining OAuth2 tokens which requires webscraping. Also, I'm planning to utilize aiohttp for asychronous API calls to speed up my app I plan to build on top of this.

If you would like to contribute, feel free to help.
